# seatselector

This is a solution to the [Coursera Seat Selector](https://www.coursera.org/learn/showcase-create-a-responsive-seat-selector-ui-in-html-css-js/home/week/1) project.

## Overview

### The Challenge

In this project you will create a responsive UI for dynamic seat reservation and management for cinemas and theaters, allowing users to view occupied and available seats, and reserve their own seats, from multiple devices.

- [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)

### What I Learned

This project gave me further practice creating dynamic HTML elements. I furthered my knowledge by researching how to make sure these dynamic elements are accessable. I also gained further experience in randomly adding and removing class names to elements.
